# iDEAL Payment Integration with PayPal JavaScript SDK

## üåü Overview

This guide covers the integration of iDEAL payments using the PayPal JavaScript SDK. It provides a seamless payment experience for Dutch customers, allowing you to render payment fields, handle transactions, and manage webhook events.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **PayPal Account**: Sign up and obtain your PayPal REST client ID.
- **Web Server**: Set up server-side endpoints to handle order creation and payment capture.
- **JavaScript Skills**: Basic understanding to implement the SDK.

## üõ† Integration Methodology

1. **Include PayPal SDK** üõ†Ô∏è
   Add the PayPal SDK script to your HTML page with the necessary query parameters:
   ```html
   <script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&components=buttons,payment-fields,marks,funding-eligibility&enable-funding=ideal&currency=EUR"></script>

### 2. Render Payment Mark

Integrate the iDEAL mark as a payment option to allow users to choose iDEAL as their payment method. This is achieved through the PayPal SDK's Marks component.

### 3. Render Payment Fields

Use the PayPal SDK to dynamically render and customize payment fields, such as name and other relevant details. This ensures the payment form fits your site's branding.

### 4. Render Payment Button

Create and display the PayPal payment button. Configure the button to create and capture PayPal orders, managing the payment process directly through the PayPal SDK.

### Response order APi

```json
   Sample response
{
   "id":"ORDER-ID",
   "status":"PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED",
   "payment_source":{
      "ideal":{
         "name":"Firstname Lastname",
         "country_code":"NL"
      }
   },
   "links":[
      {
         "href":"https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/ORDER-ID",
         "rel":"self",
         "method":"GET"
      },
      {
         "href":"https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/payment/ideal?token=ORDER-ID",
         "rel":"payer-action",
         "method":"GET"
      }
   ]
}

### **5. Capture the Transaction**

Handle transaction capture using the PayPal SDK's `onApprove` function. This involves processing the payment once the user approves the transaction.

### **6. Handle Webhook Events**

Set up a webhook handler to manage PayPal events. This includes handling events such as order approval and payment capture, ensuring your server responds appropriately to PayPal notifications.
